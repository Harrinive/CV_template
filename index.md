## Research Interests
Quantum Computation, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Information, Deep Learning Theory

## Research Experiences

### **Characterization on Linear Photonic Chips with Machine Learning** `Sep. 2019 – Present`

_Advisor: Xian-Min Jin_
- Simulated Boson sampling experiment with python.
- Investigated three existing characterization methods that could apply to Boson sampling on photonic chips.
- Based on TensorFlow, I established an integrated optimizing model with multiple constraints on it.
- Adapted gradient descent method on my model which reduced the error of Bristol characterization method significantly.

### **Research on the Learning Process of Neural Networks (NN)** `Sep. 2019 – Feb. 2020`

_Advisor: Zhi-Qin Xu_
- Learned to build arbitrary NN models with TensorFlow.
- With discrete Fourier transformation, revealed the difference in learning processes on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
- Visualized the convolution kernels in CNN and observed their changing features while learning.

### **Research on Quantum Algorithms Based on Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)** `Aug. 2020 – Present`

_Advisor: Xian-Min Jin_

- Attended the Qiskit Global Summer School and learned to use qiskit as a tool to implement all kinds of algorithms. Also, I learned many knowledge about the superconducting qubits.
- Studied related quantum algorithms, their implementation and performance. For example, Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), Quantum Principle Component Analysis (QPCA) and HHL algorithm for solving linear equations.
- Organize the contents, find relationships between them and come up with new developments. (haven’t finished yet)

### **Other Contributions** `Sep. 2018 - Nov. 2019`

- **Algebraic Machine Learning (AML) & N Queens Problem:** Studied AML algorithms, realized them in python scripts with group members and applied it to supervised learning and unsupervised learning. (Sep. 2019 – Mar. 2020, Adviser: Jian-Hui Shang)
- **Shining Light on Quantum Transport in Fractal Networks:** Compared the simulating and experimental result of quantum walk on fractal waveguide arrays and processing the data to figures on the paper. (Sep. 2019 – Mar. 2020, Advisor: Xian-Min Jin, Collaborator: Xiao-Yun Xu)
- **Reconstruction of Quantum Channel via Convex Optimizing:** Learned to conduct an optical experiment and analysed the data with Origin. (Sep. 2018 – Nov. 2019, Advisor: Xian-Min Jin, Collaborator: Xuan-Lun Huang)
- **Recognition of Anderson Localization with Machine Learning:** Simulated quantum walks on waveguide arrays of different shapes (Square, triangle, hexagon…) with MATLAB and analysed the evaluation patterns of result with ML. (Sep. 2018 – Nov. 2019, Advisor: Xian-Min Jin, Collaborator: Xuan-Lun Huang)
